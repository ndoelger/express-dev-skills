Routes
    what does the "router.get" do to the returned router
    Cleaning caches?
Controllers
    "Index" and "Show", can we technically rename those or is there something intrinsic
    Just one word in the object, is that shorthand for them being the same?
    Confused about "skills: Skill.getAll()
    What about req.params.id do I need to know
Models
    Confused about my route from findOne to the controllers
